   - Expected impact
   - Any suggested mitigation

- Unsafe file upload or path traversal
- API authorization bypass

## Response Expectations

The project maintainer will review credible reports and determine:

- Whether the issue is reproducible
- Whether the issue affects the current public version
- Whether a fix, mitigation, or disclosure note is required

Please avoid publishing exploit details before the maintainer has had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and patch the issue.
